# CS260
This is a repo for everything for my Web Programming class CS 260.
Change from my development environment! And it is working so well!

This is a change that I have made in the github browser environment, and it seems like it is a way easier way to look at it. Also, it means that I can edit it on any 
device on which I am logged into github.
